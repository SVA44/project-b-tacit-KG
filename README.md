# project-b-tacit-KG 
Project B main page. <br/>
The project pipeline: Interview Transcipts/Discussions -> Sentence synthesizing/labelling -> Translate into Cypher Query -> Set up KGs in Neo4j -> Show in frontend <br/>
Current plan: Manually separate sentences using a sample data source, then translate into Cypher queries. Automate the process using Mistral 7B and FastAPI <br/>
